Paths through code 
for these tests we will show gdb console outpt
of tracing 4 execution paths,
we will know if the tests succeed if the 
they make it all the way through the 
execution path,furthermore I had 
added print statements that execute
when a if statement is called, define TEST
to turn them on

1. Keyboard gets input and sends it to the server
who then sends it to the printer and the printer thread
ouputs the message in the console

2.Keyboard gets input and sends it to the server
who then sends it to the transmitter thread and sends
it across the network 

3 Receiver gets a message and sends to the server
who then sends it to the printer, at which point 
it is printed to stdout 

4.Keyboard gets the exit code EXIT and begins termination
of the program


Multiple computer tests
for these tests we will show console output of 2 
terminals of machines communicating with each other 
using s-chat
for clarity sake we will modify output slightly to 
have headers of MACHINE 1 and MACHINE 2, so that it 
is easier to decipher who is sending to who
We will omit any tests for this part of pairs
of machines that are known not to work
with each other (see documentation for more 
details on this matter)
we will know that our tests work
if the messages are sent across the network
and the messages are not garbled or 
in some strange format


5.Testing communcation between 2 machines
both on a drone machine

6.Testing communcation between 2 machines
one on ppc and other on drone machine


7.testing communcation between 2 machines 
that have different architectures  
one on ppc and other on arm 


Other tests:
8. sending a message over the 2048 characterss
precisely a message of 8's spanning 2049 character
(generated by python), should send the first 2048 8's 
and the other 1 afterwords
also note the wc limit was intentionally violated in the
output file
