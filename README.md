# s-chat-
A simple chat program that uses the udp
protocol, to transmit data to and from another
s-chat user

We use 5 threads, one that waits for keyboard input
one that sends data to the other user. One that 
waits for data to be recieved. One that prints to
console. And a server thread that coordinates and
synchronizes all of the other threads
